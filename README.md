# Period-Date-Predictor


This AI-powered predictor uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to forecast the next period date based on past menstrual cycle data.

## Tech Stack:
- **Flask**: Web framework to build the API.
- **LSTM**: Deep learning model for accurate predictions.
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend for user interface.

## Features:
- AI-based prediction for accurate forecasting of menstrual cycles.

## Dataset:
- The model is trained on my personal period cycle data.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run `app.py` to start the Flask application.
4. Access the app locally on `localhost:5000`.

## Future Improvements:
- Add more features like period flow prediction or cycle irregularity detection.
- Improve model accuracy with more data.
